            Call me <b><a href="./pages/ishmael.html">Ishmael.</a></b> Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.

            It is a way I have of <u><a href="./pages/driving_off_the_spleen.html">driving off the spleen</a></u> and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; </a>whenever it is a damp, <i>drizzly November in my soul</i>; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my <mark><font color="red"><a href="./pages/hypo.html">hypo</a></font></mark> get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. <em>This is my substitute for pistol and ball.</em>

         With a philosophical flourish <mark><a href="./pages/cato.html">Cato</a></mark> throws himself upon his; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some <font size="5"><b><a href="./pages/time.html">time</a></b></font> or other, cherish very nearly the same <i><a href="./pages/feelings.html">feelings</a></i> towards the ocean with me.

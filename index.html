                Call me <a href="./pages/ishmael.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ishmael.</span></a> Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a way I have of <a href="./pages/driving_off_the_spleen.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">driving off the spleen</span></a> and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; </a>whenever it is a damp, <span style="font-style: italic;">drizzly November in my soul</span>; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my <a href="./pages/hypo.html"><span style="background-color: red; color: white;">hypo</span></a> get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This is my substitute for pistol and ball.</span>
            </p>
        
            <p>
            With a philosophical flourish <a href="./pages/cato.html"><span style="background-color: orange;">Cato</span></a> throws himself upon his; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some <a  href="./pages/time.html"><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">time</span></a> or other, cherish very nearly the same <a href="./pages/feelings.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">feelings</span></a> towards the ocean with me.
